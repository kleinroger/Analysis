+ [Break] Breaking changes against v5.6.0:
    + The default theme has been changed, including the visual style and the default location settings of components and series. For example, the default legend position is now at the bottom of the canvas. The new default settings are more reasonble, but if they affect the existing usage, use `echarts/theme/v5.js` to restore the old visual style and location settings. See [#20865](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/20865).
    + The v5 `echarts/src/theme/light.ts` is now migrated to `echarts/theme/rainbow.js`.
    + The position of Cartesian axes might shift slightly if the axis names or labels previously overflowed the canvas or overlapped, as anti-overflow and anti-axisLabel-axisName-overlap mechanism are enabled by default. In most cases that changes will be indiscernible to the naked eye. But if any unreasonable change occurs, you can use option `grid.outerBoundsMode: 'none'` to disable the anti-overflow mechanism, and/or use option `xAxis/yAxis.axisLabel.nameMoveOverlap: false` to disable the anti-axisLabel-axisName-overlap mechanism. See [#21059](https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/21059).
    + The percent base of the option `center` (such as the base of `'33%'`) on `geo`, `series.map`, `series.graph` and `series.tree` are changed. The previous percent base is incorrect. But if you need to restore, set `legacyViewCoordSysCenterBase: true` (on the root level of an echarts option). See [#19807#issuecomment-2974437299](https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/19807#issuecomment-2974437299).
    + Now label rich styles (`fontStyle`, `fontWeight`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `textShadowColor`, `textShadowBlur`, `textShadowOffsetX`, `textShadowOffsetY`) are changed to inherit the plain label styles. You can use `richInheritPlainLabel: false` (on the root level of an echarts option, or at the same level of the label style options) to restore it. See [#20977](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/20977)
